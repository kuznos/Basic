Syntax	Direction	Purpose
(event)	Inbound	Receiving data via an event (e.g., click, custom emit)
[property]	Outbound	Sending data to a component via input binding


The square brackets [] indicate property binding.
[productid] is the name of the input property defined in the child component using the @Input() decorator.

using parentheses () in the template indicates event binding, which means you're handling data coming from the browser or child component into your logic
(click) is the syntax for event binding—it listens for a click event on an element and triggers a method in your component when that event occurs.

<button (click)="doSomething()">Click Me</button>


1. DOM Event (Click):
html
<button (click)="doSomething()">Click Me</button>
➡️ User clicks → doSomething() runs → data flows into your component logic

2. Custom Event from Child Component:
Child (child.component.ts):
ts
@Output() clicked = new EventEmitter<string>();

Child Template:
html
<button (click)="clicked.emit('Hello')">Say Hi</button>

Parent Template:
html
<app-child (clicked)="handleMessage($event)"></app-child>

Parent Component:
ts
handleMessage(message: string) {
  console.log(message); // Output: "Hello"
}
